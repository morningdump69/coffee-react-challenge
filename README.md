this project is a coffee ordering webpage using collaborative technologies with myself and liam.

we added seperate colour scheme to the original.

we added the feature to be able to delete orders.

made each part into their own component.

names were all shown in uppercase no matter what the input was.

added a payment roulette which would select one name from the array to pay for all the coffees.

added a reset button to reset the page and clear orders.

disabled input being entered after the payment roulette was acrivate to prevent more data being added to the orders array.

added the ability to type a size of coffee that you wanted to order.

addey a keycode for the enter keypress to submit aswell as the submit button.
